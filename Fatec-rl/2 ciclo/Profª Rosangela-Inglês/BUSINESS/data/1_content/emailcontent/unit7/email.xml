______________________________________________________________________________
Dear all

A new security system for visitors starts on Monday. First of all, if you <span class='blue'>have an appointment</span> with a visitor, please tell Reception one day before. All visitors need to <span class='blue'>sign in</span> at Reception when they arrive. They will then receive <span class='blue'>a visitorâ€™s pass</span>. They need to keep this pass at all times. 

To visit <span class='blue'>the R&amp;D Department</span>, visitors need a special pass. In this case, please contact Marion Shakespeare. She is <span class='blue'>responsible for security</span> in R&amp;D and the technical centre (her telephone is extension +129).

If you have any questions, please email me or call me on extension +121.

Thanks

Bill Wheel
