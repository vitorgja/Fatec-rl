______________________________________________________________________________
Dear Davis

We are currently choosing a new supplier for the ice cream in our motorway restaurants: Theodore Foods or Redd Ltd. Please find attached more information on both companies.

Theodore Foods already supply ice cream to our competitors. They have <span class='blue'>a wide range of products</span> and their <span class='blue'>delivery times are excellent</span>.

But personally I prefer Redd Ltd. They produce <span class='blue'>high quality</span> ice cream and their prices <span class='blue'>are similar to</span> Theodore Foods. <span class='blue'>And the advantage of</span> Redd is that they have a range of organic ice cream. I think that will be very popular with our customers.

Would you be happy with that decision?
Best wishes
Jay
