______________________________________________________________________________
Hi Shintaro

Thank you so much for the visit to your office in Japan last week. The trip was great. All the hotels were very <span class='blue'>comfortable</span> and the food was <span class='blue'>delicious</span>. Thank you very much for arranging such a <span class='blue'>nice</span> visit.

It was <span class='blue'>my first trip</span> to Japan and I learned a lot. I thought that the Plastics <span class='blue'>Industry Expo was</span> especially useful. I think that Iâ€™ll send some of our <span class='blue'>Sales Managers</span> there next year.

Thank you once again and I hope to see you in Boston in December!
All the best
Naomi
