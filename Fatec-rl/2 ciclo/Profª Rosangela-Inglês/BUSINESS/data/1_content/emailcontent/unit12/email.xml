______________________________________________________________________________
Dear Don

Please find attached <span class='blue'>the schedule</span> for Rogue Street’s tour of the USA <span class='blue'>in the summer</span>. The band arrives <span class='blue'>on July 3</span> and returns to the UK <span class='blue'>on July 31</span>. <span class='blue'>The aim is</span> to play all the main music festivals in the country.

<span class='blue'>We have already</span> booked most of the concerts but we are having problems contacting some of the organizers. <span class='blue'>Why don’t we</span> arrange a call next week to discuss this?

We also need some more help. The band <span class='blue'>are going to</span> travel between some cities by bus. <span class='blue'>How much time do we need</span> to travel between San Diego and Seattle? And between Atlanta and Miami?

Thanks for all your help on this project.

With very best wishes

Rebecca
