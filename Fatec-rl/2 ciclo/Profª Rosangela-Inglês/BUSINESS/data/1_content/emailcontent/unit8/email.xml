______________________________________________________________________________
Hi Gail

Next month we are interviewing three candidates for the new manager for Germany and Austria. These are second interviews and <span class='blue'>we’d like you to meet</span> the candidates too. <span class='blue'>Are you free</span> to come to Stuttgart in the week beginning 23 June (week 26)?

<span class='blue'>We also need to meet</span> about the conference in Bonn at the end of the year. It’s important that we talk to Russell about this too. <span class='blue'>Is he busy</span> that week or can he come to Germany with you?

<span class='blue'>Please let me know as soon as possible</span>.

<span class='blue'>Regards</span>
Torsten
