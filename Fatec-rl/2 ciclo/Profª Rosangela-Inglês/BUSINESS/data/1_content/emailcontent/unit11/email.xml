______________________________________________________________________________
Dear Sir or Madam 

<span class='blue'>I would like to book three double rooms at your hotel for four nights from 4-8 January</span>. Could you also <span class='blue'>order a taxi from the airport</span> on 4 January? We are arriving in Saint Petersburg at 20.00 local time. <span class='blue'>I would also like to book a table for dinner in the hotel restaurant</span> for the evening of 4 January.

<span class='blue'>I saw on your website that there are several meeting rooms at the hotel. Is there one available</span> on 5 January? We <span class='blue'>are going to have an</span> all-day meeting that day for twenty people. 

Thank you very much for your help.

Yours faithfully

Isabel Crane
