      <p><b>Enzo</b> Hello, can I join you?</p>
      <p><b>Giang</b> Yes, please take a seat. My name's Giang Bai. How do you do?</p>
      <p><b>Enzo</b> My name's Enzo Matti. </p>
      <p><b>Giang</b> Is this your first time in Vietnam?</p>
      <p><b>Enzo</b> Yes, it is. I'm with a textile company in Italy. Here's my card.</p>
      <p><b>Giang</b> Thank you. Here's mine. So you're from Italy. That's a long way to travel. How long did your journey take?</p>
      <p><b>Enzo</b> Er, it took about forty-eight hours, I think. I came to Ho Chi Minh City last night, but I left Bologna two days ago. I flew to Milan and then to Shanghai. I had a day in Shanghai so I met some colleagues there yesterday. </p>
      <p><b>Giang</b> Were you on the ten o'clock flight last night?</p>
      <p><b>Enzo</b> That's right. </p>
      <p><b>Giang</b> Oh, we were on the same flight then!</p>
      <p><b>Enzo</b> Really?</p>]]>
