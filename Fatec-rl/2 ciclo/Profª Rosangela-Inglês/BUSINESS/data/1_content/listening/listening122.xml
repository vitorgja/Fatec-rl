      <p><b>Greta</b> At the moment, the schedule is about a week late. The situation is that the raw material from Nepal has just arrived and we've already taken it to the warehouse. So the aim is to get the soap on the shelves by Valentine's Day.</p>
      <p><b>Soledad</b> But what's the deadline for this? I know we need it for February the fourteenth, but what date is the launch? </p>
      <p><b>Greta</b> We plan to launch it on January the twentieth. </p>
      <p><b>Soledad</b> But Martin, how much time do we need for production?</p>
      <p><b>Martin</b> Production isn't a problem. But we haven't got a final package yet.</p>
      <p><b>Greta</b> I know. I've spoken to the designers again today. We'll have the packaging by the thirty-first of October.</p>
      <p><b>Martin</b> OK. So we'll have the final product by the end of December?</p>
      <p><b>Greta</b> That's right. Around the twentieth.</p>
      <p><b>Soledad</b> Why don't we deliver the product at the beginning of January? The shops are going to want it earlier than the twentieth. </p>
      <p><b>Greta</b> OK. Then, let's start delivery from the warehouse on January the second. Is everyone happy with that date?</p>
      <p><b>Martin / Soledad</b> Fine. No problem.</p>
      <p><b>Greta</b> Right. So, to summarize, I'm going to call our packaging people – again. And we're going to tell clients they'll have the product by January the ...?</p>
      <p><b>Soledad</b> Let's say January the fifth. I'll tell them. And I'm going to prepare some press releases as well.</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal><b> Greta</b><b> </b>Great.</p>]]>
