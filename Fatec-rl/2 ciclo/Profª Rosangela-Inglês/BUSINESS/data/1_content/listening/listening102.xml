      <p><b>Richard</b> Morning, Adriana. How was your weekend?</p>
      <p><b>Adriana</b> Fine, thanks.</p>
      <p><b>Richard</b> Is Jorge coming?</p>
      <p><b>Adriana</b> Yes, but he's speaking to the team leader on line two at the moment. I think he was late again. </p>
      <p><b>Richard</b> What? Again? </p>
      <p><b>Adriana</b> That's three times this month.</p>
      <p><b>Richard</b> OK, let's start. How are things on production line one?</p>
      <p><b>Adriana</b> Marcio, the team leader, says they are still having problems because the line is slow.</p>
      <p><b>Richard</b> Didn't the new components arrive on Friday?</p>
      <p><b>Adriana</b> No, but the supplier says they are arriving later today. </p>
      <p><b>Richard</b> And when are you going to the factory in Recife?</p>
      <p><b>Adriana</b> Tonight. I'm leaving at six.</p>
      <p><b>Richard</b> So, is Marcio dealing with the new components when you're in Recife?</p>
      <p><b>Adriana</b> Yes. He's fine. He can organize the changes.</p>
      <p><b>Richard</b> Good. Who are you meeting in Recife tomorrow?</p>
      <p><b>Adriana</b> Pedro, the Line Manager, and the team leaders.</p>
      <p><b>Richard</b> So what are the problems in Recife? </p>
      <p><b>Adriana</b> The biggest problem is that production's slow. Pedro says the new components don't work well.</p>
      <p><b>Richard</b> Are these the same components we're waiting for?</p>
      <p><b>Adriana</b> That's right! </p>]]>
