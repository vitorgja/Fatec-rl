      <p><b>Security</b> Good morning sir. </p>
      <p><b>Jim</b> Hello, I have an appointment at Whitley's. </p>
      <p><b>Security</b> Do you want the factory or the offices?</p>
      <p><b>Jim</b> The offices.</p>
      <p><b>Security</b> Well, you go along this road and turn right. Go past the factory to the offices, but don't park there. Look for the car park sign and drive down below the offices and go into the car park there.</p>
      <p><b>Jim</b> That's great. Thanks a lot.</p>]]>
