      <p><b>Interviewer</b> So where is your company exactly?</p>
      <p><b>Zuckerman</b> It's in Palo Alto, in California.</p>
      <p><b>Interviewer</b> You are a CEO, so are you at work all the time? </p>
      <p><b>Zuckerman</b> Yes, I am. But my work colleagues are also my friends. For example, Dustin Moskovitz, Head of Engineering, is a friend from college. And Adam D'Angelo is my Chief Technology Officer. We're old friends from school.</p>]]>
