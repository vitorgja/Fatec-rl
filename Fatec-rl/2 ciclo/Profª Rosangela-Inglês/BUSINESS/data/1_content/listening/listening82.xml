      <p><b>Anton</b> OK. So we have a student for the summer job. Let's discuss the web editor position next. Who do we have?</p>
      <p><b>Sandra</b> There were lots of emails for this one, but there are only two people really. First of all, there's Monica. I spoke to her on the phone and she's very friendly. At the moment she works in publishing.</p>
      <p><b>Anton</b> Is she an editor?</p>
      <p><b>Sandra</b> Yes. She has a lot of experience in book editing, but she says she's good at editing websites because she does some in her free time for friends and small businesses.</p>
      <p><b>Anton</b> OK. That sounds like a possibility. What about the other person?</p>
      <p><b>Sandra</b> Here's his picture. Do you recognize him?</p>
      <p><b>Anton</b> Yes, who is he?</p>
      <p><b>Sandra</b> It's Roberto. He was the student on our summer placement last year.</p>
      <p><b>Anton</b> That's right. Roberto! I remember him. Very energetic! Really nice young man.</p>
      <p><b>Sandra</b> Exactly. Anyway, now he has a qualification in IT. </p>
      <p><b>Anton</b> But why is he applying for the web editor job? He doesn't have any experience in editing and he isn't very good at working on his own.</p>
      <p><b>Sandra</b> I know, but he liked it here so much last summer he wants a job. I think he's perfect for the position of web production assistant.</p>
      <p><b>Anton</b> Exactly. Let's offer him that and then invite Monica for an interview. I'd like to see the websites she worked on as well.</p>
      <p><b>Sandra</b> Sure. I'll send you the links.</p>]]>
