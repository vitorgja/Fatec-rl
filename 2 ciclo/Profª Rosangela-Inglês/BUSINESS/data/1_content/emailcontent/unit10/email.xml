______________________________________________________________________________
Hi Bertil

I’m just emailing about the new assistant manager position. There are two candidates: Dan Ellis and Anneke Meis.

<span class='blue'>The CEO thinks</span> Anneke is the best candidate. Anneke has an MBA and she speaks Dutch, English, and French. <span class='blue'>But I don’t think we should choose</span> her because she has no experience in the shipping industry.

<span class='blue'>Ruud thinks</span> we should give the job to Dan. He already works for us and he is very popular. Some people say he is not experienced enough to be a manager, <span class='blue'>but I disagree</span>. In fact, he’s very good at solving problems and working with a team. <span class='blue'>In my opinion</span>, he is the best candidate.

What do you think?

Chris
