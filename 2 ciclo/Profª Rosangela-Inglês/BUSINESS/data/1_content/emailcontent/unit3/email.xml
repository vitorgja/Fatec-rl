<b>To</b>&nbsp;		<u>Alison Yorke</u><br><b>From</b>&nbsp;	 <u>Robin Bromwich </u><br><b>Subject</b>&nbsp;	 Visit Jaume Domenech
______________________________________________________________________________
Hi Alison
<span class='blue'>Jaume Domenech arrives on Friday so please check that we have everything ready for his visit</span>. 

We’ll give our presentations in the meeting room. We need a projector, and diagrams of the project on the walls. <span class='blue'>There isn’t a wireless connection</span> in the meeting room at the moment so can you call an engineer to arrange that, please?

Jaume likes Indian food so can you book lunch at The Mumbai Palace? We need a table for five people.

<span class='blue'>One more question: is there a parking space for him?</span> He’ll also need an <span class='blue'>info pack</span> about the company. <span class='blue'>I think that’s everything</span>.

Thanks
Robin
