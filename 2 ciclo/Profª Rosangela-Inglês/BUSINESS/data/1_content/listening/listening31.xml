      <p>Good morning. Today, I'd like to tell you about Spectrum Brands. We're a global company with our head office in Atlanta and a technical centre in Madison, Wisconsin. We do our research and development there. We also have twenty-one factories in North America and four more in Latin America: in Guatemala, Brazil, and Colombia. There are two factories in Europe: in Germany and the UK. Oh, and there's also one in China. Now moving on to sales, there are about forty sales offices worldwide. There are ten in North America, thirteen in Latin America, three in Asia-Pacific, fourteen in Europe, and one in Dubai for customers in the Middle East and Africa. We also have thirty-eight distribution and packaging centres around the world.</p>]]>
