We export soy sauce all over the world, including Asia, North America, Australia, and Europe. We also develop new products for the pharmaceuticals industry. Restaurants, supermarkets, and Asian food shops buy our products and we also provide lessons in Japanese cooking – using Kikkoman products of course!</p>]]>
