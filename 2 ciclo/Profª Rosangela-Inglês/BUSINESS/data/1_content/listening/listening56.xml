      <p><b>Joe</b> Joe speaking.</p>
      <p><b>Mandy</b> Hi, Joe. It's Mandy again.</p>
      <p><b>Joe</b> Hi, Mandy.</p>
      <p><b>Mandy</b> I'm sorry Joe, but we've got a problem with the order for Gosport. We did all the baseball bats and T-shirts yesterday, so I can ship them tomorrow. But the logos on the caps didn't work. The colours are wrong. We need to fix the machine today and print them again. I'm really sorry.</p>
      <p><b>Joe</b> OK. Don't worry. I know the Purchasing Manager at Gosport, so I'll speak to him and explain the situation. But can you help me? We need to give another delivery date for this.</p>
      <p><b>Mandy</b> Sure. I'll call the factory now and I'll let you know as soon as I can.</p>
      <p><b>Joe</b> That would be great. Thanks a lot.</p>]]>
