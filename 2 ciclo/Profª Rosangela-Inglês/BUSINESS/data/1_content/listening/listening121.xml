      <p><b>Greta</b> Hello, Greta Helsing speaking.</p>
      <p><b>Barati</b> Hi Greta, it's Barati in Kathmandu.</p>
      <p><b>Greta</b> Oh, hi Barati.</p>
      <p><b>Barati</b> Hi. Thanks for your email about the Palmarosa oil. We've sent it and it's going to arrive on the twenty-seventh. I know you have a tight deadline, but we've had a few problems here.</p>
      <p><b>Greta</b> Don't worry. The twenty-seventh is OK. I can change the schedule by a week.</p>
      <p><b>Barati</b> Have you taken lots of orders for the soap?</p>
      <p><b>Greta</b> Yes, there's been a lot of interest.</p>
      <p><b>Barati</b> Great. Have you seen some of the other products on our website?</p>
      <p><b>Greta</b> Yes, I have. They look really interesting. </p>
      <p><b>Barati</b> You should come and visit us sometime. Have you ever been to Nepal?</p>
      <p><b>Greta</b> No, I haven't, but I'd love to!</p>]]>
