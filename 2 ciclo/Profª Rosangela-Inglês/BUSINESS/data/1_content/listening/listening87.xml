      <p><b>Kasia</b> Hi Bruno. It's Kasia here.</p>
      <p><b>Bruno</b> Hi Kasia. How are you?</p>
      <p><b>Kasia</b> Fine, thanks. Listen, we need to meet about the plan for staff to work from home. Can we arrange a meeting on Thursday with Dolores and Chen? Is two o'clock OK for you?</p>
      <p><b>Bruno</b> Sorry, I'm busy then. What about the morning?</p>
      <p><b>Kasia</b> OK. What time are you free?</p>
      <p><b>Bruno</b> Nine thirty is good for me.</p>
      <p><b>Kasia</b> I can't meet between eight and ten. I've got interviews.</p>
      <p><b>Bruno</b> Are you busy after that? </p>
      <p><b>Kasia</b> Dolores and I have an appointment with someone from the bank at twelve, so let's meet before that.</p>
      <p><b>Bruno</b> Is ten fifteen good for you?</p>
      <p><b>Kasia</b> Yes, a quarter past ten on Thursday is fine, but I don't know about Dolores and Chen. I think Chen has a factory visit in the morning.</p>
      <p><b>Bruno</b> OK. Can you call Dolores and I'll phone Chen?</p>
      <p><b>Kasia</b> Sure.</p>
      <p><b>Bruno</b> Thanks. Bye.</p>]]>
