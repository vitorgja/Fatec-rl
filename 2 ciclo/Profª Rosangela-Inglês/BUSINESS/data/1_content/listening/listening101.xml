      <p><b>A</b>  Right. So, is that everything?</p>
      <p><b>B</b>  Erm, there's a small problem with my assistant. She wants more money, but I can't give her a pay rise.</p>
      <p><b>A</b>  Oh I see. Can she do some overtime?</p>
      <p><b>B</b>  Yes. That's a good idea!</p>
      <p>2</p>
      <p><b>A</b>  What's the matter?</p>
      <p><b>B</b>  I have a really big problem. The Managing Director wants to reduce staff numbers in my department. So someone has to lose their job. But who?</p>
      <p><b>A</b>  That's a difficult decision.</p>
      <p><b>B  </b>Yes, it is!</p>
      <p>3</p>
      <p><b>A</b>  So, what's your final decision?</p>
      <p><b>B</b>  I don't know. I can't decide.</p>
      <p><b>A</b>  Why don't you ask everyone in your team?</p>
      <p><b>B  </b>No. That's a bad idea. There are eight people so we'd get eight different opinions. We'll never find a solution that way.</p>]]>
