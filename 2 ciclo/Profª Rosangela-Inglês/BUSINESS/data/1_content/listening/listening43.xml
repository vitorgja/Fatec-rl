      <p><b>Magda</b> Sorry, can you help me?</p>
      <p><b>Chen</b> Sure.</p>
      <p><b>Magda</b> How do I use the new Intranet?</p>
      <p><b>Chen</b> Do you have a password?</p>
      <p><b>Magda</b> Yes, it's here. I'm trying to key it in, but it doesn't work.</p>
      <p><b>Chen</b> That's because the password is in lower case letters. Don't use upper case letters.</p>
      <p><b>Magda</b> Oh!</p>
      <p><b>Chen</b> That's it. So here is 'Company News'. And you can also send messages.</p>
      <p><b>Magda</b> How?</p>
      <p><b>Chen</b> First of all, click on 'My Intranet'. Next click on 'Messages'. So it's similar to email. You have an inbox and you can send messages to people at work. OK?</p>
      <p><b>Magda</b> That's great. Thanks.</p>
      <p><b>Chen</b> Do you want a hand?</p>
      <p><b>Magda</b> That would be good. I don't know how to log out now.</p>
      <p><b>Chen</b> Er. Close your messages and then click on 'sign out'.</p>]]>
