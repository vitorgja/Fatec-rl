      <p><b>A</b>  Hello. Is this the check-in for all BA flights?</p>
      <p><b>B</b>  Yes, it is. Do you have your passport and ticket?</p>
      <p><b>A</b>  Here you are.</p>
      <p><b>B</b>  And how many bags are you checking in today?</p>
      <p><b>A</b>  None. I just have hand luggage.</p>
      <p><b>B</b>  OK. Would you like a window or an aisle seat?</p>
      <p><b>A</b>  Er, aisle please.</p>
      <p><b>B</b>  OK. So your flight leaves from gate forty-nine at six fifty-five, but boarding starts half an hour before. You're in seat five C.</p>
      <p><b>A  </b>Thanks.</p>]]>
