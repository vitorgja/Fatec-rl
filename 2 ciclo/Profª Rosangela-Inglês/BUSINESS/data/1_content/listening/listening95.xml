      <p><b>Managing Director</b> So, did you look at the two quotes for the website?</p>
      <p><b>Javier</b> Yes briefly. Er ... here they are.</p>
      <p><b>Managing Director</b> OK. How do they compare? </p>
      <p><b>Javier</b> For price, ITE is cheaper.</p>
      <p><b>Managing Director</b> Yes, so I see. Why is that?</p>
      <p><b>Javier</b> They're a smaller, newer company. It's two brothers. Weblines is older and it has about twenty staff.</p>
      <p><b>Managing Director</b> Are they better?</p>
      <p><b>Javier</b> The quality is similar. Weblines produces very nice sites, but ITE also does good work. The advantage of ITE is the two people have experience in the online marketing and sales industry. The disadvantage of Weblines is they don't usually work with online businesses.</p>
      <p><b>Managing Director</b> How fast can they do the work?</p>
      <p><b>Javier</b> There's no difference. They both need four months. </p>
      <p><b>Managing Director</b> Four?</p>
      <p><b>Javier</b> That's fairly normal.</p>
      <p><b>Managing Director</b> I see. Well, what do you think?</p>
      <p><b>Javier</b> Erm. I prefer ITE. They're cheaper, they're professional, but also easy to talk to. I like their work – it's more modern. </p>
      <p><b>Managing Director</b> Fine. Let's choose them.</p>
      <p><b>Javier</b> Good. I'll call them today.</p>]]>
