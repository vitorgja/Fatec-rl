      <p><b>Malik</b> You too. Where do you work?</p>
      <p><b>Natasha</b> I'm with Perfect Match. It's a small recruitment company. We provide staff – especially in the pharmaceuticals industry. What about you?</p>

      <p><b>Natasha</b> Oh right. What about you, William? Do you still work in electronics?</p>
      <p><b>William</b> Well, yes, but I don't have a job right now. That's why I'm here. I want to find something in the automobile industry, if possible.  </p>]]>
