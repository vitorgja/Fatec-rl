      <p><b>Piotr</b> Hello?</p>
      <p><b>Lydia</b> Hi, Piotr. It's Lydia. You called.</p>
      <p><b>Piotr</b> Yes, I just wanted to check if you called Ron Peters.</p>
      <p><b>Lydia</b> Yes, I did. Yesterday.</p>
      <p><b>Piotr</b> What did he say? Is there a problem?</p>
      <p><b>Lydia</b> No, not really. He can do the presentation, but not in the morning.</p>
      <p><b>Piotr</b> Why didn't he want to speak then?</p>
      <p><b>Lydia</b> No idea. Anyway, I telephoned the Century Hotel. They have a free room at lunchtime.</p>
      <p><b>Piotr</b> That's fine. Did you book it?</p>
      <p><b>Lydia</b> No, I didn't. Sorry about that. I'll call them now and I'll check with Ron Peters.</p>
      <p><b>Piotr</b> Great. Thanks Lydia.</p>]]>
