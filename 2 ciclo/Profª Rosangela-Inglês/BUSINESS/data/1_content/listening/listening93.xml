      <p><b>A</b>   Our competitive advantage is that we provide a better service.</p>
      <p><b>B</b> What do you mean exactly?</p>
      <p><b>A</b>  Well, our staff are more experienced than our competitors' staff. They get six weeks' training before they start.</p>
      <p><b>B</b> So they can give good advice to your customers?</p>
      <p><b>A</b> Yes, that's right. And our staff are friendlier than other shops. We know our customers well because we often see them.</p>
      <p><b>B</b>  What about the products?</p>
      <p><b>A</b>  Well, when there's a new product on the market, we're always the first shop in town to stock it. Customers know that our products are more up-to-date. They come here first to see the technology.</p>

      <p><b>B</b>  What are your competitive advantages?</p>
      <p><b>C</b>  Well, the first one is the price. We offer lower prices than our competitors.</p>
      <p><b>B</b> That's because you don't have any shops?</p>
      <p><b>C</b>  Yes, but also because we buy products in large quantities. We have thirty thousand cubic metres of storage space, so we have bigger stocks than all our competitors.</p>
      <p><b>B</b>  Is that an advantage for delivery, too?</p>
      <p><b>C</b>  Yes, of course. Because we have large stocks we provide faster delivery. We always deliver in two or three days. And we offer a wider choice – five thousand different products.</p>]]>
